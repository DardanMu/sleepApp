sleepApp
========

This is a small program which counts backwards in 90min seep cycles to reccomend a sleep time or wake up time to the user depending on what time they input. Based off this article: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-16964783

This code was written entirly by myself, Dardan M.
This isn't the best looking code, and could be re-written in a better way, but I wrote it to help myself understand pointers in C.
